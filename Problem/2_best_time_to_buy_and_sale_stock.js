  Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
  Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

        profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - buy) //This ensures we always record the best profit possible at each step.
